Hi and welcome to my todolist (u03)!


In this to do list i choose to do a simple and clean todolist, where the user can Create, edit and remove task. I created it so that it could be easy for everyone. 
I added categories where users can store store task in diffrent categorie. 

The function of the list is as followed: The user needs to create a task. The next step could be "do/undo"/"edit" or even "delete" the task. The user will be able to se all his/her task once they launche the platform!
